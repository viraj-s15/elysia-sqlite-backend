# bun-sqlite-backend

Wanted to try out bun as it looked cool, this is just a simple notes
app implemented in bun and elysia

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.0. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
